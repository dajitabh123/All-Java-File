   "**** Static method ****"  :-
  ============================

1. Definition:-

         A static method is a method that belongs to a class, 
   but does not belong to an instance of that class and this 
   the method can be called without the instance or object of 
   that class.

2. Accessing members and methods In the static method:- 

          The method can only access only static data members and 
   static methods of another class or same class but cannot access
   non-static methods and variables.

3. Binding process:- 

       The static method uses compile-time or early binding.

4. Memory allocation:-

      In the static method, less memory is used for the execution 
   because memory allocation happens only once because the static 
   keyword fixed a particular memory for that method in ram.

5. Overriding:-

   The static method cannot be overridden because of early binding.


   "**** Non-static method ****" :-
  ================================


1. Definition:-

   Every method in java defaults to a non-static method without a 
   static keyword preceding it. non-static methods can access any 
   static method and static variable also, without using the object 
   of the class.

2. Accessing members and methods In the static method:-
   
    In the non-static method, the method can access static data 
    members and static methods as well as non-static members and 
    methods of another class or the same class. 

3. Binding process:- 

   The non-static method uses runtime or dynamic binding.

4. Memory allocation:-

   In the non-static method, much memory is used for the execution 
   because here memory allocation happens when the method is invoked 
   and the memory is allocated every time when the method is called. 

5. Overriding:-

   The non-static method can be overridden because of runtime binding.
